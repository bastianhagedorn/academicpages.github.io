# Available Dissertation Topics
This is an overview of the currently available topics for bachelor and master dissertations.
If you have any questions or are interested in one or more topics feel free to drop me an email.

## Automatic Optimization of Image Processing Pipelines in Lift
(Suitable for master students)
Image Processing Pipelines are applications consisting of multiple simple computations which together form a computation graph.
An example for such an application is the Harris Corner Detection algorithm which consists of multiple Matrix Multiply and Convolution nodes.
Scheduling and fusing these computations to achieve highest performance is a non-trivial task.
This thesis should extend Lift with the functionality to express, optimize and execute computation graphs.

(Suitable for bachelor and master students)
This is a text describing the topic

## Optimizing Stencil Computations for Intel Xeon Phi using Vectorization
(Suitable for bachelor students)
Optmizing programs for Intels Xeon Phi accelerator is an interesting challenge as it requires to efficiently use the wide vector registers availabe in AVX-512.
In this thesis, stencil computations such as simple convolutions applications, shall be analyzed and systematically optimized on Intels newest Xeon Phi platforms.

## Evaluation of the PPCG Polyhedral Compilation Framework
(Suitable for bachelor students)
PPCG, is a state-of-the-art polyhedral complier which automatically generates OpenCL and CUDA programs.
In this thesis, the performance achieved by PPCG and Lift shall be evaluated using multiple benchmarks.

## Evaluation of the Futhark Optimizing Compiler
(Suitable for bachelor students)
[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/) is a new functional language designed to be compiled to high-performance OpenCL code targeted for GPUs.
Similar to Lift, Futhark relies on automatic rewriting of functional programs during the optimization phase of their compiler.
In this thesis, the performance achieved by Futhark and Lift shall be evaluated using multiple benchmarks implemented in both languages.

## Implementing an Evaluation Module for the Auto-Tuning Framework (ATF)
(Suitable for bachelor students)
The ATF is an auto-tuning framework developed at the University of MÃ¼nster.
An auto-tuner automatically optimizes a program which contains so-called _tuning parameters_ by generating and systematically exploring the space of possible values for each of these parameters. 
In this thesis, the ATF will be extended with a new module which, at the end of the automated tuning, systematicaly analyzes the results.
This consists of generating multiple plots for the achieved results.
Often enough, observing the same results using different metrics reveals new insights and information.
With the help of the new module, the analysis of the produced data shall be significantly simplified and easily configurable to the developers needs.
