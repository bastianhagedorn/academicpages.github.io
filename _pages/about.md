I am a PhD student at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany. 
As a member of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PVS/en/index.html) I am mostly working on code generation and compilers for parallel systems.
In close collaboration with the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, I am one of the main developers in the [Lift Project](http://www.lift-project.org) working on high-performance code generation for [stencil computations](http://www.lift-project.org/stencils).

You can find my CV on [GitHub](https://github.com/bastianhagedorn/cv/blob/master/hagedorn_cv.pdf).
