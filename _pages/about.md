Hi, I'm Bastian Hagedorn. I'm a compiler developer at NVIDIA and I focus on high-performance code generation and optimizations for deep learning applications. 

I recently graduated from the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany where I worked on achieving [High-Performance Domain-Specific Compilation without Domain-Specific Compilers](/publications/2020/thesis).
I'm generally interesting in all things related to compilation, program optimization, and parallel programming. 
I have a background in [compiler construction](/publications/2020/arxiv-fireiron) and [rewrite-based optimization](/publications/2020/ICFP).

You can find my CV on [GitHub](https://github.com/bastianhagedorn/cv/blob/master/hagedorn_cv.pdf).
