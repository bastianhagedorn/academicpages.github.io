I am a fourth-year PhD student in the computer science department at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany.
I am part of the [Parallel and Distributed Systems group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PVS/en/index.html) supervised by Professor Sergei Gorlatch.
Ever since my master studies, I have been actively contributing to the [Lift Project](http://www.lift-project.org) in collaboration with Dr Michel Steuwer (University of Glasgow) and Dr Christophe Dubach (University of Edinburgh) and performed multiple successful research visits every year.
More recently, I'm working as one of the main developers on [Rise](https://github.com/rise-lang), a spiritual successor to Lift, and I'm the leading developer of [Elevate](https://github.com/elevate-lang) a language for specifying optimization strategies.
I am generally interested in code generation and compilers for parallel systems with a special focus on [stencil computations](http://www.lift-project.org/stencils) and [program optimization using rewrite rules](https://bastianhagedorn.github.io/files/talks/2019/Google-Summit-2019.pdf).

Research Abstract
======
In my research, I aim to achieve performance-portability, that is to allow a single portable program to be executed with high performance across a diverse set of computer architectures. 
I am tackling this ambitious challenge by proving a tool chain which combines high-level programming abstractions and modern compiler technology by exploiting application and architecture domain knowledge.
My work on optimizing [stencil computations](/publications/2018/CGO) has shown that it is possible to have an expressive, generic high-level language in which problems are specified while at the same generating high performance code which matches or outperforms hand optimized reference implementations. 
In the future, I plan to use these ideas to develop a flexible DSL for tensor computations which will be compiled into a novel AI domain specific IR allowing to experiment with optimizations and use modern code generation techniques to generate high performance GPU code.

You can find a more detailled description of my research [here](/research).
